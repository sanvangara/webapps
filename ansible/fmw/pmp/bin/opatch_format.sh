# Script to give a summary view of patches applied to an Oracle Home.
# Similar to "opatch lspatch" but also shows the applied date and 
# for one-offs, fetches the patch description from 
# $ORACLE_HOME/inventory/oneoffs.  Currently shows opatch version, 
# oracle_home location and then the patch information.
#
# Author: Rakesh Tatineni
#
# Accepts one argument, --csv, which removes the opatch/ohome info
# and the field descriptions/titles and adds a field seperator.
# Useful if you want to feed this data into another script.
